      ## Overview
      Publications are managed as an Epic issues containing non-epic sub-issues (tasks, meetings, workshops, etc.). They should be created/transferred within the Publication repo and follow an output oriented life cycle process:
      1. Proposal / Call submission (define the gist and framework)
      2. Publication notes (planning and research)
      3. Output of material (supporting figures, tables, etc.)
      4. Drafting of the manuscript (writing it down)
      5. Submission (putting things together nicely)
      6. Review (responding to comments from publisher)
      7. Publishing (archiving published and non-published material)
      For all practical matters, we follow the [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org), unless instructed otherwise by the publisher.
