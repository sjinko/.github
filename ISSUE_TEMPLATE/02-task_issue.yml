      Task issues serve to manage and track simple sets of actions. They are managed by one assignee who organizes, documents, tracks and closes the task. To create a task:
      1. Name the task clearly by stating what will be achieverd using an action verb the details
      Eg. *"Task: Write draft of 'AI & Cities' paper by Jun. 15"*
      2. Assign **one** person. The task assignee is responsible to coordinate listed actions and deliver the task on time
      3. Add to relevant projects. Project managers are responsible to coordinate epics and deliver projects on time
      4. Link back to an epic issue. With a few exceptions, every task should belong to at least one epic in the same repo
