      ## General
      This template manages the attribution of keys to new collaborators, including request, registration, tracking, and return processes. Each key has a unique identifying code that must be registered and tracked in the key log. Key can be borrowed in exchange of a caution deposit.
      
      ## Roles
      The management of key includes the following roles:
       - Borrower: Person who receives a key to access spaces at the UNESCO Chair
       - Chair holder: Shin Koseki
       - Caution holder: Person who receives and returns caution deposits
       - Key master: Person who manages the distribution and retrieval of key

       ## Key Use Agreement
       The key is the property of the University of Montréal under the full responsibility of the Borrower, and shall be proactively returned in person to the Key master by them at the end of the hosting period (contract, mission or affiliation) with the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape no later than the last day of the said period. The key shall also be returned at any moment if requested by the Chair holder or any member of the university’s administration. The Borrower shall not lend the key to anyone, including other members of the university, and shall immediately inform the Chair holder and the Key master if the key is lost, stolen, broken or destroyed. If the Borrower is not able to return the key after the termination of their hosting period, they can be held responsible of any material and financial lost associated with the misuse of the key by them or by others.

       ## Caution Deposit
       In order to receive a key, the Borrower may be required to make the deposit of a caution to the Caution holder. It is the sole reponsibility of the *Borrower* to arrange the return of the key and caution in due time and claim the deposit back from the *Caution holder* when returning the key. A deposit not claimed within 30 days after the end of the hosting period shall be considered forfeited.
