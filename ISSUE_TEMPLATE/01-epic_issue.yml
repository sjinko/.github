      1. Name the epic clearly by stating what will be achieverd using an action verb the details
      Eg. *"Epic: Publish 'AI & Cities' paper in *Nature* by Oct. 1"*
      2. Assign **one** person. The epic assignee is responsible to coordinate listed tasks and deliver the epic on time
      3. Add to relevant projects. Project managers are responsible to coordinate epics and deliver projects on time
